"# A LITTE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
Select a customer in the "User view to view the ticket(s) of that user. Currently its only possible to add one ticket per customer. This project was mostly for learning purposes but it could be added to add more tickets per customer. You can delete the user and the ticket in the datagrid, and you can go into details view to update the information about the current ticket of the user.

There is no current password or admin role set for this project. The project "assumes" it is only the admin that has access to this app. 

It is entirely possible to migrate the sql database to add a password field into the users table, and rebuild the constrain relationship with the tickets table. However, this would require quite a bit of extra work in the c# code to get it working, so this part was omitted for this project in this stage.
